        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Isaiah Lara. I am currently a pre-business major at the University of California, Riverside. I am 19 years old and will be attending UCR for another year. I hope to study business operations as I aspire to become an Operations Manager at a large corporation. I am currently seeking for an internship for a business for the summer of 2021. <br><br>

        Previously, I attended Silverado High School where I was involved in Student Leadership, ASB, for 3 consecutive years. I gained experience such as communicating with other peers about improvements about the school environment. I also was able to be apart of an organization where we could make change. On my third year, I became a class officer, specifically treasurer. In being class treasurer, I managed the funds for our class and gained experience in data entry. Currently, I am working as a student at UCR and will branch out to oversee clubs at the school. I am working at my father's company, Elite Design, in managing the financial statements and account. I work with data entry, making financial decisions for the company, calculating future costs and profits, and communicating to make positive changes for the company. Elite Designs is a non-profit business that allows workers to gain experience in home design. Such work that the company does is remodeling, building, and finalizing designs on a home. In addition, I am involved in a club, Latino Union, where we as a community come together to help the people around us. We engage in improving our community and provide service to those in need.<br><br>

        I am bilingual, proficient in both English and Spanish. This can allow me to prosper in a diverse work environment as I am capable of communicating to many clients. I have experience in customer satisfaction, teamwork, responsibility, and time management. I can make a positive change in your company. I am always eager to bring positivity and drive to the people around me. I love to challenge myself to learn new projects, and work to find, fix, and grow from the errors. I initiate to make a difference in my work and want to leave an admirable reputation on a company's clients, missions, and results. Outside from college, I find enjoyment in art and love exploring the various forms that art offers. Traveling and watching movies are my go to hobbies. Ways that I am able to incorporate my hobbies into a professional setting is becoming aware of the ideologies, customs, people behavior, views, and environment where people live when I travel. Traveling allows me to connect with others, learning through the eyes of the people around me. Art is a way where I am able to express my creativity. Creating art trains my mind to look for alternative solutions, think outside the box, and to make the assignment as best to my ability. Finally, watching movies allows me to research the realities of the plot. I love to discover new ideas that I find in movies that I watch.
